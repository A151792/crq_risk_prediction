Summary of work entailed:
The CRQ involves implementing new temporary authorization codes for the Production IOF (Input/Output Facility) on the mainframe. The previous temporary keys are set to expire on 9/4/2024, and the new keys will extend the expiration through 9/25/2025. The change is scheduled to occur on 2024-08-29 from 15:00 to 16:00. The change is noted to be impactful but has been approved as a standard change without the usual 2-day lead time due to vendor constraints.

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change pertains to the mainframe management system, specifically dealing with authorization codes.
2. The change is categorized under ""Infrastructure Services"" and ""ETS"" (Enterprise Technology Services).
3. The change involves a maintenance activity, which typically carries a moderate risk.
4. The change is scheduled to occur within a one-hour window, indicating a relatively short implementation period.
5. The change is noted to be impactful, suggesting potential disruptions or dependencies.

Rules-based analysis:
1. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change. (If the CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change:1:3)
2. The CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure, as noted in the change notes. (If the CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure:1:3)
3. The change request status is ""Draft,"" which typically indicates a higher risk level. (If the change request status is 10 on CRQs whose status is draft or scheduled. This does not apply to CRQs whose risk is closed.:2:3)
4. The change is noted to be impactful, which suggests a higher risk level. (If the impact score is relatively low:1:2)
5. The task includes potential adjustments and consultation with other members of the team, as indicated by the involvement of multiple parties. (If the task includes potential adjustments and consultation with other members of the team:3:4)

Summary of risk:
The risk score for this CRQ is determined to be medium. The change involves updating authorization codes on a mainframe system, which is a critical infrastructure component. While the CRQ includes a clear and detailed description, as well as a backup plan, the change is noted to be impactful and is currently in a draft status. Additionally, the involvement of multiple parties and the potential for adjustments during implementation contribute to the overall risk level.

Summary of work entailed:
The CRQ involves an automated reboot of servers SCTFSP30, SCTFSP28, and SCTFSP29. The change is scheduled to occur within a maintenance window and will be managed by BMC Orchestrator. The CRQ includes an implementation plan, verification plan, and backout plan within the notes. If the change fails, the requester and Server Operations team will be notified, and existing monitoring will detect any issues and issue appropriate incidents and alerts.

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change involves an automated reboot of servers, which is a routine maintenance task.
2. The change is scheduled to occur within a maintenance window, minimizing the impact on business operations.
3. The implementation, verification, and backout plans are included in the notes, ensuring a structured approach to the change.
4. The change is managed by an automation tool (BMC Orchestrator), which can reduce human error but also introduces a dependency on the tool's reliability.

2. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change (1:3).
3. The CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure (1:3).
4. The change request status is draft (2:3).

Summary of risk:
The risk score for this CRQ is medium. The use of an automation tool and the inclusion of detailed implementation, verification, and backout plans contribute to a lower risk. However, the draft status of the CRQ and the potential for issues during the automated reboot process elevate the risk to a medium level.

Summary of work entailed:
The CRQ involves making DNS and LTM (Local Traffic Manager) changes in a non-production environment. Specifically, it includes adding new aliases and LTM VIPs (Virtual IPs). The change is scheduled to start and end on the same day, with the implementation being manual. The change is being managed by Maria C Benavente and implemented by Mitchell R Darmon.

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change pertains to network infrastructure, specifically DNS and LTM changes.
2. The environment affected is a non-production (Stress) environment.
3. The implementation is manual, which can introduce human error.
4. The change involves adding new aliases and LTM VIPs, which are critical components in network traffic management.

Rules-based analysis:
1. The change pertains to Network Infrastructure and Hardware, which is considered high risk (3:4).
2. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change (1:3).
3. Several teams are involved, including IOCD Projects Teams/Vendors (3:3).
4. The implementation plan, verification plan, and backout plan are mentioned but not detailed in the notes, which could be considered absent (general rule for implementation, verification, and backout plans).

Summary of risk:
The risk score is determined to be medium due to the nature of the change involving network infrastructure, which inherently carries higher risk. The detailed description of the change and involvement of multiple teams add to the complexity. However, the fact that it is in a non-production environment and the absence of a detailed implementation, verification, and backout plan in the notes mitigate the risk to some extent.

Summary of work entailed: The CRQ involves a migration of the Metro CyberArk Vault to Pure Storage. The task implementer is Gordon McPheator, and the change is categorized as an upgrade. The scheduled start and end times are on August 27, 2024, from 15:00 to 18:00. The change is currently in the ""Implementation In Progress"" status and has been submitted by Gordon McPheator. The risk level is identified as ""Risk Level 1.""

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change involves migrating storage systems, specifically to Pure Storage, which is a high-end data storage system.
2. The change is related to the Metro CyberArk Vault, which is a critical security component.
3. The implementation, verification, and backout plans are mentioned in the notes, indicating a structured approach to the change.

Rules-based analysis:
1. The CRQ involves a high-end data storage system (Rule: If the product involved is a high-end data storage system:2:5).
2. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change (Rule: If the CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change:1:3).
3. The CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure (Rule: If the CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure:1:3).
4. The task involves expanding server storage that is not Oracle based (Rule: If the task involves expanding server storage that is not Oracle based:1:4).

Summary of risk: The risk score is determined to be medium due to the involvement of a high-end data storage system and the critical nature of the Metro CyberArk Vault. While the CRQ has a clear and detailed description and includes a backup plan, the complexity and potential impact of the storage migration elevate the risk level. The structured approach with implementation, verification, and backout plans helps mitigate some of the risks, but the overall impact and criticality of the systems involved warrant a medium risk score.","Medium

Summary of work entailed: The CRQ involves an upgrade with no impact on OpenShift. The change includes updating Red Hat Advanced Configuration Management (ACM) policies using a GIT repository. The implementation, validation, and backout plans are detailed in the notes.

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change involves updating ACM policies, which is a software configuration management task.
2. The change is related to OpenShift, a container orchestration platform.
3. The change does not involve hardware, network infrastructure, or high-end data storage systems.

Rules-based analysis:
1. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change (1:3).
2. The CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure (1:3).
3. The impact score is relatively low (1:2).
4. The change request involves patching (1:5).

Summary of risk: The CRQ is considered low risk due to the clear and detailed implementation, validation, and backout plans. The change is software-based, specifically related to ACM policies in OpenShift, and does not involve high-risk hardware or network changes. The impact is minimal, and the backup plan is well-documented.",Low,"The CRQ involves an upgrade with no impact on OpenShift.

Summary of work entailed:
The CRQ involves implementing new temporary authorization codes for the Production IOF (Input/Output Facility) on the mainframe. The previous temporary keys are set to expire on 9/4/2024, and the new keys will extend the expiration through 9/25/2025. The change is scheduled to occur on 2024-08-29 from 15:00 to 16:00. The change is noted to be impactful but has been approved as a standard change without a 2-day lead time due to vendor constraints.

Summary of work entailed:
The CRQ involves an automated reboot of servers SCTFSP30, SCTFSP28, and SCTFSP29. The change is scheduled to occur within a maintenance window and will be managed by BMC Orchestrator. The implementation, verification, and backout plans are detailed in the notes.

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change involves an automated reboot of servers, which is a routine maintenance task.
2. The change is scheduled to occur within a maintenance window, minimizing the impact on business operations.
3. The implementation, verification, and backout plans are clearly described in the notes, ensuring a structured approach to the change.
4. The change is managed by an automation tool (BMC Orchestrator), which can reduce human error but also introduces a dependency on the tool's reliability.

Summary of work entailed:
The CRQ involves making changes to the DNS and LTM (Local Traffic Manager) configurations in a non-production environment. Specifically, it includes adding new aliases and LTM VIPs (Virtual IPs). The change is being implemented manually by Mitchell R Darmon and is scheduled to take place on August 27, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change pertains to Network Infrastructure and Hardware, specifically DNS and LTM configurations.
2. The environment affected is a non-production (Stress) environment, which generally reduces the risk compared to production environments.
3. The change involves manual implementation, which can introduce human error.
4. The change does not involve any automated tools or scripts for deployment.
5. There is no mention of a rollback plan, which could complicate recovery if issues arise.

Summary of risk:
The risk score is determined to be medium due to the nature of the change involving network infrastructure and hardware, which inherently carries a higher risk. The absence of a detailed rollback plan and the manual implementation method also contribute to the risk.

Summary of work entailed: The CRQ involves a migration of the Metro CyberArk Vault to Pure Storage. The task implementer is Gordon McPheator, and the change is categorized as an upgrade. The scheduled start and end times are on August 27, 2024, from 15:00 to 18:00. The change is currently in the ""Implementation In Progress"" status and has been submitted by Gordon McPheator. The risk level is identified as ""Risk Level 1.""

Technology-based analysis:
1. The change involves migrating the Metro CyberArk Vault to Pure Storage, which is a significant infrastructure change.
2. The task involves storage systems, which are critical components in IT infrastructure.
3. The change is categorized as an upgrade, which typically involves enhancements or improvements to existing systems.
4. The implementation, verification, and backout plans are mentioned in the notes, indicating a structured approach to the change.

Rules-based analysis:
1. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change (If the CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change:1:3).
2. The CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure (If the CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure:1:3).
3. The product involved is a high-end data storage system (If the product involved is a high-end data storage system:2:5).
4. The change request involves a large-scale server move to the Metro Data Center (If the change request involves a large-scale server move to the Metro Data Center:3:5).

Summary of risk: The risk score is determined to be medium due to the nature of the change involving a significant migration of critical storage systems. While the CRQ has a clear and detailed description, and includes a backup plan, the involvement of high-end data storage systems and a large-scale server move to the Metro Data Center increases the potential risk.

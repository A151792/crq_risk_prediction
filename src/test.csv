**Summary of work entailed:**
The CRQ involves implementing new temporary authorization codes for the Production IOF (Input/Output Facility) on the mainframe. The previous temporary keys are set to expire on September 4, 2024, and the new keys will extend the expiration through September 25, 2025. The change is categorized as maintenance and is scheduled to occur on August 29, 2024, from 15:00 to 16:00. The change is noted to be impactful but has been approved as a standard change without the usual 2-day lead time due to vendor constraints.

**Technology-based analysis:**
1. **Mainframe Management**: The change pertains to the mainframe management system, which is a critical infrastructure component.
2. **Authorization Codes**: The change involves updating authorization codes, which are essential for system security and access control.
3. **Scheduled Maintenance**: The change is scheduled for a specific time window, indicating planned downtime or potential service impact.
4. **Impactful Change**: The notes mention that the change is impactful, suggesting a significant effect on the system or users.

**Rules-based analysis:**
1. **Clear and Detailed Description**: The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change, including the implementation, verification, and backout plans. (Rule: If the CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change:1:3)
2. **Backup Plan**: The notes include a backup plan in case of failure, which is essential for mitigating risks. (Rule: If the CRQ includes a backup plan in case of failure:1:3)
3. **Impactful Change**: The change is noted to be impactful, which increases the risk level. (Rule: If the task includes potential adjustments and consultation with other members of the team:3:4)
4. **Draft Status**: The change request status is ""Draft,"" which typically indicates that it is still under review and not yet finalized. (Rule: If the change request status is 10 on CRQs whose status is draft or scheduled. This does not apply to CRQs whose risk is closed.:2:3)

**Summary of risk:**
The risk score for this CRQ is determined to be medium. The change involves updating critical authorization codes on the mainframe, which is a significant and impactful task. While the CRQ includes a clear and detailed description, as well as a backup plan, the nature of the change and its potential impact on the system elevate the risk level. Additionally, the change is currently in draft status, indicating that it is still under review and may be subject to further modifications.

**Summary of work entailed:**
The CRQ involves making changes to the DNS and LTM (Local Traffic Manager) configurations in a non-production environment. Specifically, it includes adding new aliases and LTM VIPs (Virtual IPs). The change is being implemented manually by Mitchell R Darmon and is scheduled to start and end on the same day, August 27, 2024. The change is categorized under the Network tier and is currently in the ""Implementation In Progress"" status.

**Technology-based analysis:**
1. The change involves DNS and LTM configurations, which are critical components of network infrastructure.
2. The environment affected is a non-production (Stress) environment, which reduces the immediate impact on end-users.
3. The change is being implemented manually, which introduces a higher risk of human error compared to automated processes.
4. The change does not involve any rollback plan, as the new VIPs are not being used yet, which could complicate recovery if issues arise.

**Rules-based analysis:**
1. The CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change. (Rule: If the CRQ has a clear and detailed description of the implemented change:1:3)
2. The change pertains to Network Infrastructure and Hardware. (Rule: If the change pertains to Network Infrastructure and Hardware:3:4)
3. Several teams are involved, including the IOCD Projects Teams and Vendors. (Rule: If several teams are involved:3:3)
4. The implementation plan, verification plan, and backout plan are not explicitly detailed in the notes, which should be considered absent. (General rule about plans being absent)

**Summary of risk:**
The risk score is determined to be medium due to the nature of the change involving critical network components (DNS and LTM), the manual implementation process, and the involvement of multiple teams. While the change is in a non-production environment, the absence of a detailed backout plan and the manual nature of the implementation elevate the risk.
